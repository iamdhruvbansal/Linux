        "Question 01: What is Linux?\n",
        "```\n",
        "  - Linux is a **command line interface based operating system**. Eg: Redhat, CentOS, AWS Linux etc\n",
        "  - Linux is an **operating system** like Windows & macOS.\n",
        "  - That help us to **manage computer hardware & resources** & allows us to run our applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "Question 02: What is the difference between hard link & soft link?\n",
        "```\n",
        "  - **Hard Link:** It's essentially a **second name or pointer** to the **same exact data** on the hard drive. If we delete the original file, the link still works because the data stays until all links are deleted. Think of it as a clone; they share the same data block.\n",
        "  - **Soft Link (Symbolic Link):** It's a **shortcut** or a **pointer to the original file's name/path**. If you delete the original file, the soft link breaks and becomes useless, pointing to a non-existent file. It's like a Windows desktop shortcut.\n",

        "Question 03: What is a Kernel in Linux?\n",
        "```\n",
        "  - The **Kernel** is the **core** or **heart of the operating system**. It's the first program loaded when the system starts.\n",
        "  - It acts as the **middleman** (or translator) between the **hardware** (CPU, memory, devices) and the **running software/applications**, managing all resources efficiently.\n",

        "Question 04: How do you create a user account?\n",
        "```\n",
        "  - By using command **`useradd`**\n",

        "Question 05: What is the 'grep' command used for in Linux?\n",
        "```\n",
        "  - **`Grep`** command is used to **identify or find the specific string pattern** within files or linux directories.\n",

        "          - **`groupadd g1`**, **`groupadd g2`**, **`groupadd g3`** (To create the groups)\n",

        "         Step 3: Whenever he creates a file automatically in the group section of file group g1 should come.\n",
        "          - The user's **primary group** needs to be set to `g1`.\n",

        "        Step 2: \"abhi\" should be the owner of the directory. He should be able to create files and delete file inside the directory and also he should be able to add content to all files inside directory.\n",
        "        - To change the owner of the directory: **`sudo chown abhi /tmp/bg`**\n",
        "        - To ensure the owner (`abhi`) can read, write, and execute (which is needed to enter the directory, create files, and delete files), the owner permission should be `rwx` (which is **7**).\n",
        "        - **`sudo chmod 755 /tmp/bg`** (This gives `abhi` full control (7) and others read/execute (55) to walk through the directory).\n",
